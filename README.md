# GENERATE ANIME CHARACTERS

### Implement

#### 1. Self Attention-GAN

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08318.pdf

Implemented with Attention, Conv2DTranspose, hinge loss and spectral norm.

The SAGAN was trained in batchsize=64 and cost only 3GB GPU memory. It needs about 50000 steps for training.

#### 2. BIG-GAN

https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096?context=cs.LG

The BIGGAN was trained in batchsize=64 and cost 16GB GPU memory (batchsize=32 cost 10GB GPU memory for 1080Ti). It needs only 10000 steps for training.
